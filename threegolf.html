    about me:
I've started playing golf when i was 6 years old, but i started to do some competitions 
at the age of 10.
Currently i do competitions almost every weekend, and pratice 5 times a week. 
We need to learn that when we do competitions not every one goes right and there has been 
a lot of times that i have been sad that i didnt classify in a good place of the leaderboard.
I have two main dreams that i want to achieve: 
1- is to enter in the national italian women's golf. 
2- go in american univeristy for example the UCLA. 
The important competitions that i have won:
Finale circuito saranno famosi 2021
and venice open that is an international tournament that everyone all around the world can come and play.
