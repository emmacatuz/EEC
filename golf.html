    <H1> GOLF IS A BEAUTIFULL SPORT</H1>
    <h3>I reccomend this sport to people who love staying in the nature and having fun.
        first when i started golf it was very difficult, so it takes a lot of practice 
        and patience.
        I've started playing golf when i was 6 years old, but i started to do some competitions 
        at the age of 10.
        Currently i do competitions almost every weekend, and pratice 5 times a week. 
        We need to learn that when we do competitions not every one goes right and there has been 
        a lot of times that i have been sad that i didnt classify in a good place of the leaderboard.
        I have two main dreams that i want to achieve: 
        1- is to enter in the national italian women's golf. 
        2- go in american univeristy for example the UCLA. 
        The important competitions that i have won:
        Finale circuito saranno famosi 2021
        and venice open that is an international tournament that everyone all around the world can come and play.
        Anyways now i talked about myself its better if i start explaining how you play golf.
        Currently i will tell you the really basic stuff you need to know when you start playing.
        You wonder where do you write the shots you did in a hole, well actually in a piece of paper,
        that is called the score that is given by the starter at the begging of the competition. 
        Well, how do you win? You win when after 18 holes when you do less shots in total then the other competitors.
        Obviously when its winter there are not competitions but winter is the best time to pratice.
        In the begging it's very diffuclt to start playing golf, but with a lot of determination and pratice.
