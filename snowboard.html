<h1 class="heading-vibes"> SNOWBOARD </h1>

<p class="pharagrgh-concert"> 
    I have been doing snowboard for over 7 to 8 years.
    I stared this sport because my uncle has done it for a few years and 
    he wanted me and my cousins to learn how to snowboard instead of skiing.
    This sport isn't that very simple, just like skiing, but once you get a hang of 
    it you'll be going down fast and maybe learn some tricks.
    I recommend this sport to people that would like to change from a diffrent sport 
    because maybe you would like to do a diffrent sport.

<h3>How to snowboard:</h3>
<p class="pharagrgh-concert">First of all you need a snowboard.
    Once you have a snowboard you start to go down, but if your going down, don't put all of your weight forward or else you will fall,
    and trust me you do not want to fall forward.
    You need to find a way tto balance yourself by keeping some weight in the back but not too much our then your sitting down.
