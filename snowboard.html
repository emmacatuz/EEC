<h1 class="heading-vibes"> SNOWBOARD </h1>

<p class="pharagrgh-concert"> I've done snowboard for 7-8 years. 
    I stared this sport because my uncle has done it for some years, when me 
    and my cousins where born he told us that he wanted us to learn snowboard instead of skiing.
    This sport isn't that simple, just like skiing, but once you j√¨get a hag of it you'll be going down fast and maybe learn some tricks.
    I recommed
