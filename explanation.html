            <p>LIBERO:
He plays on the second line and deals with both reception and defense. 
He does not deal with batting, blocking or attacking. It may therefore not necessarily be high.

            <p> DRIBBLER or LIFTER:
            
He's in charge of sorting the balls to the hitter. 
Height, precision and strategy are required.

            <p> SIDE HITTER or HAND:
                
                He deals with both attack and reception and plays between the first and second lines. 
                He is the one to whom the setter relies to close the decisive points of a match</p>

                <p> HITTER:
                    
                    He also deals with blocking the dunks of the opponents</p>
